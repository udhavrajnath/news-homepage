## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I completed this project mainly to review and practice my CSS skills. Throughout this project, CSS grid was the primary area of focus as seen in this code snippet extracted from the Home.css file

```css
.Homepage{
    background-color: transparent;
    width: 75%;
    height: 90%;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 11% 65% 20% ;
    grid-row-gap: 1.5%;
    font-size: 15px;
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
    font-family: 'Overpass', sans-serif;

}
}
```
